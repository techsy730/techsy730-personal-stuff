/**
 * The root interface for all function types.<p>
 * 
 * Users of the API will rarely need to deal with this interface directly.
 * It is mostly to facilitate compile time type safety in the absence of variable argument generics.
 * Instead, most users will want to look at the FunctionN interfaces, where N is the number of arguments needed.
 * These provide much "cleaner" interfaces to work with, and deal with complexities of the "generics chaining" mechanisms for the user.
 *

 * @author C. Sean Young
 *
 * @param <R> The return type of the method, or Void if this function returns no value.
 *              If the argument type(s) cannot be known at compile time, it is OK for this to be defined as Object or left a raw type.
 * @param <T> The argument type of the method, or an ArgumentPair if there is more than one argument.
 *              Can be Void to indicate no parameters.
 *              see {@link #getArgumentCount()} for more rules about T's type.
 *              If the argument type(s) cannot be known at compile time, it is OK for this to be defined as Object or left a raw type.
 *              If T is left as a raw type OR if it is declared to be an Object due to its type not being knowable until runtime,
 *              then T is not considered well defined at compile time.
